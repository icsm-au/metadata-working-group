The sde module provides the stub methods of the ArcSDE library.  This module is required because the ArcSDE libraries cannot be included in
an opensource project.  They require licencing and therefore the jar created by this module should be replaced on the production server
with the correct one if ArcSDE harvesting is to be performed.
