This is the default location for schemas that have been plugged into GeoNetwork.
(see web/geonetwork/WEB-INF/config.xml).

Plugin schemas added as zip archives through the Administration->Add Schema 
interface are expanded into this directory. This directory is also scanned
at startup and any schemas in this directory are added to GeoNetwork.
